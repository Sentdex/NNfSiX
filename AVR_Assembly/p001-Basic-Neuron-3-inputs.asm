; TITLE:       p001-Basic-Neuron-3-inputs 
; PROCESSOR:   Attiny85
;
; DESCRIPTION: I know this is insane, but also a great learning experience :D
;              I'm not sure yet about some points, for example:
;              - negative numbers
;              
;              I use integer math
;              This will however reduce the maximum value to 255
;              With the introduction of negative numbers I am further limited to +/- 127
;              Let's see how this goes...
;
;              For the first example, we can keep everything in registers for ultra fast access
;              Later on we have to fall back to the internal SRAM
;
; CONNECTIONS: For this example no pins have to be connected.

; @return r16 - the result of the multiplication
; 
; Multiplies the values from registers r16 and r17
; Registers r18 and r19 are used for the result before it is capped
; The limit for the result is +/- 127
; In the first step, the signs of both values are investigated
; This way we know, if the result has to be negative or positive
; Then the signs are cleared
; Next, a loop is executed r16 times
; For every iteration of the loop, r17 is added to the result
; If the lower result byte overflows, the upper byte is incremented
Multiply:
    push r18 ; need this register for result
    push r19 ; need this register for result
    push r20 ; need this also
    push r21 ; also this

    ; if the bit was set (r16 is negative) it is now reset (result is positive if both are negative)
    ; otherwise the bit is now set
